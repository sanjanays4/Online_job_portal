This project aims to create a comprehensive platform that bridges the gap between students and companies by streamlining the job search and candidate selection process. Companies can efficiently search for candidates based on specific qualifications and experience, while students can search for companies that align with their skill sets and career aspirations. The platform will also analyze studentsâ€™ profiles to identify any skill gaps and suggest areas where they can improve. Additionally, it will provide a skill-based mentorship matching system, connecting students with mentors who can guide them in enhancing their abilities and preparing for their desired career paths. This approach helps students build a strong professional foundation while offering companies access to a well-prepared and skilled talent pool.
